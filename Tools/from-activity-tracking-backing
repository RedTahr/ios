// a tool to quickly print the values of activity tracking entries in a Realm database
// Realm doesn't support unsigned integers, so we have to work around this by using an
// eight-bit signed and reinterpreting back and forth.

// For values up to 127, this effectively just prints the number, as their
// representation is the same in both signed and unsigned form. For negative values,
// this effective calculates is `256 + value` (note that value is negative), so a
// value of -1 indicates 255, -2 indicates 254, up to -128 indicating 128.
